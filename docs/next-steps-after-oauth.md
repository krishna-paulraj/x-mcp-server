# Next Steps After Receiving OAuth Credentials

## 🎉 Congratulations!

You've successfully received your OAuth 2.0 Client ID and Client Secret from Twitter. Here's what to do next:

## 📋 Immediate Actions

### 1. Store OAuth Credentials Securely
```env
# Add these to your .env file (for future use)
TWITTER_CLIENT_ID=your_oauth_client_id_here
TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET=your_oauth_client_secret_here
```

### 2. Get API Keys for MCP Server
Your MCP server needs **different credentials** - the API keys:

1. **Go to "Keys and tokens"** in your Twitter app dashboard
2. **Copy the API Key and API Secret**
3. **Generate Access Token and Access Token Secret**
4. **Add them to your `.env` file**:

```env
# These are what your MCP server actually uses
X_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
X_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
X_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here
X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret_here
```

## 🔄 Current Status

| Credential | Status | Action Needed |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| OAuth Client ID | ✅ Received | Store securely |
| OAuth Client Secret | ✅ Received | Store securely |
| API Key | ⏳ Pending | Get from "Keys and tokens" |
| API Secret | ⏳ Pending | Get from "Keys and tokens" |
| Access Token | ⏳ Pending | Generate in "Keys and tokens" |
| Access Token Secret | ⏳ Pending | Generate in "Keys and tokens" |

## 🚀 Quick Setup Commands

Once you have your API keys:

```bash
# 1. Copy environment template
cp env.example .env

# 2. Edit .env with your credentials
# (Add your API keys to the file)

# 3. Test authentication
npm run test-auth

# 4. Build and start the server
npm run build
npm start
```

## 🔐 Security Reminders

- ✅ **OAuth Client Secret**: Keep this secret - never share it
- ✅ **API Credentials**: Store in `.env` file (already in `.gitignore`)
- ✅ **Never commit credentials** to version control
- ✅ **Rotate credentials** regularly for security

## 🎯 What's Next

1. **Get API keys** from "Keys and tokens"

3. **Test authentication** with `npm run test-auth`
4. **Start using your X MCP server** to post tweets!

**Remember**: OAuth credentials are for future OAuth flows, but your MCP server needs the API keys from "Keys and tokens" to function.
